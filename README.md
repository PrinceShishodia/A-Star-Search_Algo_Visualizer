# A* Search Algorithm Visualizer :

1. Developed a highly intuitive and interactive A* search algorithm visualizer using Python, providing users with a real-time visualization of the search process and enabling them to input various parameters to customize their experience.
2. Leveraged cutting-edge heuristics, including Manhattan distance and Euclidean distance, to optimize the search process and achieve efficient results.
3. Utilized object-oriented programming principles and data structures to design and implement the visualizer, demonstrating a strong foundation in computer science concepts and best practices.
4. Created a visually appealing interface for the visualizer using pygame, a Python library for game development
Implemented event handling and user input functionality using pygame's built-in functions and methods
